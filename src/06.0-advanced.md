# Advanced

In the following chapters, we will discuss in detail the inner workings of `cosock`. The subject
matter is going to shift focus from "how do I use cosock" to "how does cosock work" which may
not be of interest to everyone.

## Internals

This section will go over the contents of the `cosock.socket.internals` module and how that
interacts with the `cosock` runtime and the underlying Luasocket library.

## Run

This is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in each pass through the main loop
of `cosock.run`.
