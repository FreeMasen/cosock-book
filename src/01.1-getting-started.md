# Getting Started

The easiest way to use `cosock` is to install it with [luarocks](https://luarocks.org).

```sh
luarocks install cosock
```

`cosock` depends on both [luasocket](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket)
and [luasec](https://github.com/brunoos/luasec), when running the above command
`luarocks` will attempt to compile both of these libraries which have some system
dependencies.


## Luasocket

The version of `luasocket` we are using requires that the Lua development package is
available. 

### Linux

For Debian-based systems, you would need to run the following

```sh
sudo apt-get install liblua-dev
```

For Fedora 

```sh
sudo dnf install lua-devel
```

### Windows

TODO!!!!!!!!

### MacOS

TODO!!!

## Luasec

### Linux

Luasec depends on Openssl so you will need those development libraries

For Debian-based systems, you would need to run the following

```sh
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

For Fedora 

```sh
sudo dnf install openssl-devel
```
