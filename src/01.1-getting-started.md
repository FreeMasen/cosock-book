# Getting Started

The easiest way to use `cosock` is to install it with [luarocks](https://luarocks.org).

```sh
luarocks install cosock
```

`cosock` depends on both [luasocket](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket)
and [luasec](https://github.com/brunoos/luasec), when running the above command
`luarocks` will attempt to compile both of these libraries which have some system
dependencies.


## Luasocket

The version of `luasocket` we are using requires that the Lua development package is
available. 

### Linux

For Debian-based systems, you would need to run the following

```sh
sudo apt-get install liblua-dev
```

For Fedora 

```sh
sudo dnf install lua-devel
```

### Windows

See [the luasock docs](https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/installation.html)


### MacOS

```sh
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.5
make macosx test
```

## LuaSec

### Linux

Luasec depends on Openssl so you will need those development libraries

For Debian-based systems, you would need to run the following

```sh
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

For Fedora 

```sh
sudo dnf install openssl-devel
```

### Windows

```powershell
choco install openssl
```

### MacOS

```sh
brew install openssl
```
